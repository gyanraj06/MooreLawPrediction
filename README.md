# MooreLawPrediction
Moore's Law is an observation made by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, in a 1965 paper. He noticed that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since their invention. Moore predicted that this trend would continue into the foreseeable future.
In 1975, Moore revised his prediction, stating that the doubling would occur every two years. Despite the common misconception, Moore's Law is not a physical or natural law but rather an observation and projection of a technological trend.
